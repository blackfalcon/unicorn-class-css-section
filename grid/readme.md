#Grid Notes

Most sites using a grid seem to have worked out a 100% background that matches up with the header and footer, so the site is not just a blob in the center of the page. I would like to know how to do this without making a mess.

I haven't tried the responsive grid yet. Coming soon.

###Issues

The content looks weird without any padding on the left, but when I add padding, the integrity of the grid is compromised and my content spills over into the next line.

Related: There is a weird 20ish pixel area on the left and right of the grid that is just empty. I would prefer my backgrounds to extend into that space. Not sure how to achieve that.
